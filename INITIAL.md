# Recipe Optimizer - Initial Feature Requirements

## FEATURE:
Build a Recipe Optimizer web application that allows users to input available ingredients and receive personalized recipe suggestions with comprehensive nutritional analysis and cooking guidance.

**Core Functionality:**
- **Ingredient Input Interface**: Multi-input field where users can add/remove ingredients with autocomplete suggestions
- **Recipe Matching Engine**: Algorithm that finds recipes based on available ingredients, with partial match support (recipes that use 80%+ of available ingredients)
- **Recipe Display**: Clean recipe cards showing title, image, prep/cook time, difficulty level, and ingredient list with substitution suggestions
- **Nutritional Analysis**: Detailed breakdown per serving including calories, macronutrients (protein, carbs, fats), key vitamins/minerals, and dietary tags (vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)
- **Smart Cooking Tips**: Context-aware tips based on ingredients and cooking methods (e.g., "Let meat rest 5 minutes before slicing" for steak recipes)
- **Shopping List Generator**: For missing ingredients, with quantity calculations based on serving size
- **Recipe Scaling**: Adjust serving sizes with automatic ingredient quantity recalculation
- **Save/Favorite System**: Local storage for saved recipes and favorite ingredients

**Advanced Features:**
- Dietary restriction filtering (allergies, preferences)
- Ingredient freshness tracking with usage priority
- Recipe difficulty rating and time estimates
- Alternative ingredient suggestions for missing items
- Meal planning integration (breakfast, lunch, dinner categorization)

## EXAMPLES:
Create these example files in the examples/ folder:

**examples/sample-ingredients.json** - Example ingredient data structure with categories, nutritional info, and common substitutions

**examples/recipe-data.json** - Sample recipe objects with full metadata including ingredients, instructions, nutritional breakdown, and cooking tips

**examples/ui-mockups/** - Screenshots or wireframes showing:
- Main ingredient input screen
- Recipe results grid/list view  
- Individual recipe detail page with nutrition panel
- Shopping list generation interface

**examples/api-responses/** - Mock API response formats for:
- Recipe search results
- Nutritional analysis data
- Ingredient autocomplete suggestions

## DOCUMENTATION:
**Local Data Sources:**
- Create static JSON files for recipe database (no external API calls)
- Include pre-calculated nutritional data in recipe objects
- Store ingredient information locally with basic nutritional facts
- Implement client-side search and filtering algorithms

**Technical Resources:**
- [Nutritional Calculation Guidelines](https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/how-understand-and-use-nutrition-facts-label) - FDA standards for nutritional labeling
- [Recipe Schema.org Markup](https://schema.org/Recipe) - Structured data format for recipes
- [Measurement Conversion Chart](https://www.thespruceeats.com/recipe-conversions-486768) - For recipe scaling functionality

**Design References:**
- AllRecipes.com ingredient search flow
- MyFitnessPal nutritional display patterns
- Yummly recipe card design

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
**Performance Gotchas:**
- Use local JSON data to avoid network requests entirely
- Implement client-side search with fuzzy matching for ingredient names
- Cache search results in memory for repeated queries
- Use virtual scrolling for large recipe result sets
- Optimize image loading with lazy loading and WebP format

**Data Management:**
- Store 50-100 sample recipes with full ingredient and nutritional data
- Include common ingredients database with nutritional values
- Pre-calculate recipe compatibility scores for faster searching
- Use local storage for user preferences and saved recipes
**Data Accuracy:**
- Use reliable nutritional data sources for the static recipe database
- Handle measurement unit conversions carefully (cups vs grams vs ounces)
- Include cooking method impact on nutritional values in pre-calculated data
- Provide disclaimers for estimated nutritional values

**User Experience:**
- Handle partial ingredient matches gracefully with fuzzy search algorithms
- Provide clear visual indicators for recipe compatibility percentage
- Make dietary restriction filters prominent and easy to use
- Include portion size context in nutritional displays (per serving vs per 100g)

**Edge Cases:**
- Handle unusual ingredient names and regional variations in search
- Manage recipes with very long ingredient lists (10+ items)
- Deal with missing nutritional data for specialty ingredients
- Account for cooking loss/gain in weight during preparation

**Accessibility:**
- Ensure recipe instructions are screen reader friendly
- Provide alt text for food images
- Make nutritional info available in multiple formats (visual charts + text)
- Support keyboard navigation for all interactive elements

**Local Development:**
- No API keys or external dependencies required for testing
- Include comprehensive sample data for immediate functionality
- Use mock data that represents real-world recipe complexity
- Implement offline-first design patterns
